# The action can be referenced in workflows like:
# uses: rfprod/nx-ng-starter/.github/actions/check-origin@main
# or
# uses: ./.github/actions/check-origin

# Explanation:
# This action is useful mainly for open source projects or those projects that accept contributions through a fork strategy.
# This action can be used to skip job steps when CI is triggered in a forked repo.
# When the repo is forked by a contributor, it does not make sence to run publish/deploy steps from a fork.
# If this repo is used as a template to start a new project, one can reconfigure the default value of the 'original-owner' input in this file,
