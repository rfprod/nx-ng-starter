## Requirements

In order to run own copy of the project one must fulfill the following requirements.

### Supported operating systems

- :trophy: [Debian based Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based) - `recommended`
  - check out [this dev setup instructions](https://github.com/rfprod/wdsdu) to facilitate setting up the dev environment;
  - given that the dev environment is set up, the command `yarn install:all:linux` should install everything needed to work with the project;
- :ok: [OSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) - `should work due to similarity to Linux`
  - one will have to figure out oneself how to set up the dev environment;
  - given that the dev environment is set up, the command `yarn install:all:osx` should install everything needed to work with the project;
  - the automation scripts support the OS with relatively high probability, but it has not been tested;
- ðŸ¤· [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) - `should work, but no guarantees`
  - one will have to figure out oneself how to set up the dev environment;
  - one will have to figure out oneself how to install `protolint`, [see available installation options](https://github.com/yoheimuta/protolint#installation);
  - given that the dev environment is set up, the following commands should be used to install `shellcheck` via PowerShell;
    ```powershell
    iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
    scoop install shellcheck
    ```
  - recommended shell: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) > `Git BASH`;
  - configure Git to use LF as a carriage return
    ```bash
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    git config --global core.eol lf
    ```

### Core dependencies

- [Bash 5](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Preferred package manager

- [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) - preferred package manager for dependencies installation in the project root.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) - preferred package manager for dependencies installation in the `functions` folder.

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfprod/nx-ng-starter.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ./nx-ng-starter
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Package scripts reference

The project has lots of package scripts, check it in the `package.json` located in the project root, or use the following command (see terminal output for usage tips)

```bash
npx nx run tools:help
```

## Committing changes to the repo

Using [commitizen cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is mandatory.

Provided all dependencies are installed, and [commitizen cli is installed as a global dependency](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility), this command must be used.

```bash
git cz
```
