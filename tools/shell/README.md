## Usage

All scripts in this directory are verbose, i.e. when a script does something it reports its progress to the terminal.

Some scripts that have complex internal logic or handle different scenarios (i.e. have complex control flow) report usage errors (with examples of the correct usage) to the terminal if usage error occurs.

The scripts are not intended to be used directly by developers during local development.

Those scripts that are used during local development flow are integrated into the workspace by means of the `package.json` scripts. See command, and read the terminal output carefully

```bash
yarn workspace:help
```
